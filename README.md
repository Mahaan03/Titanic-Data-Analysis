# Titanic Data Analysis and Classification Algorithms ðŸš¢

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using various machine learning algorithms.  
The goal is to build classification models and evaluate their performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook or Python script.

## Dataset
- Titanic dataset from Kaggle [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Results
- Compared model performance.
- Identified important features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age` influencing survival.
